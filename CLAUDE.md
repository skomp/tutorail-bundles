# tutorail-bundles

A catalogue repository. Each subfolder is one self-contained tutorAIl bundle; see
`README.md` for what a bundle is and how to add one.

## Where work is tracked

**GitHub issues in `skomp/tutorail-bundles`.** Not a `TODO.md`. Every issue Claude creates
carries the `created-by-claude` label, and issue bodies are written in ASD-STE100
Simplified Technical English.

## Where course specs go

**Inside the bundle's own subfolder, as `<bundle>/SPEC.md`.** One spec per bundle, kept
with the bundle so it travels with a fork of the course. This repository does **not** use a
shared `specs/` directory at the root.

This overrides the `tutorail-authoring` create-interview default, which writes the spec to
`specs/<bundle-id>.md` outside the bundle. That default is deliberately not followed here —
a future session should keep the spec at `<bundle>/SPEC.md` and not "correct" it back. The
one consequence to keep in mind: because the spec ships inside the bundle, the validator has
to tolerate `SPEC.md`, and learners receive it with the course. Decided 2026-09-19.

## Where course-quality audits go

The findings go in an issue here, one issue per bundle. **The full report goes in
`skomp/tutorail-authoring` under `docs/audits/`**, because that is where the rubric and the
`course-quality` skill live and the report has to be readable beside them.

- `docs/audits/2026-09-12-course-quality-first-run.md` — the first run, three courses. Its
  totals are superseded; the correction note at the top says why.
- `docs/audits/2026-09-13-course-quality-all-bundles.md` — all five bundles, with the
  per-course reports in `docs/audits/2026-09-13/`.

Audits propose and never change a bundle. Applying a proposal is the `tutorail-authoring`
skill's job, after the author agrees.

## This session owns this repository, and hands the rest over

A session here handles **`skomp/tutorail-bundles`** — the bundles and their teaching
content. Two other repositories carry work that surfaces here and cannot be fixed here:

| Repository | What belongs to it |
|---|---|
| `skomp/tutorail-authoring` | the authoring toolkit and the `course-quality` rubric: `supplies.py`, `catalog.py`, `audit.py`, the validator, and every audit report under `docs/audits/` |
| `skomp/tutorAIl` | the runner: how a lesson is presented, how an offer is made, anything drawn on the learner's terminal |

**A failing validation, a tooling defect or a runner change gets filed in the repository
that has to fix it**, never here and never only in chat. Then check `ListAgents` for a
session holding that repository and message it: one message, each issue named with its
repo (`tutorail-authoring#11`, never a bare `#11`), what it is, and what is still pending.
If no session holds it, file anyway and say so in the report. The general form of this rule
is in the global `parallel-sessions` skill, section 4a.

Known sessions at the time of writing: `tutorail-authoring-db` holds
`skomp/tutorail-authoring`, and `tutorail-8c` holds `skomp/tutorAIl` — the plugin, the
bundle format contract, the validator, the catalogue and discovery. The authoring session
shares that checkout, so name which of your commits there are still local.

An issue with a half on each side gets **two issues that point at each other**, not one:
`skomp/tutorail-bundles#4` and `skomp/tutorAIl#23` are the worked example. Say in the
runner-side issue what the bundle supplies, and what the runner must do when the bundle
supplies nothing.

**A cross-repository discussion lives in the issue, not in the messages.** Told on
2026-09-13, for `skomp/tutorAIl#25`: post the answer on the issue, then ping the session
that owns it and ask for its update; it answers on the issue and pings back; repeat. The
ping is a doorbell and the issue is the record, so a reader who was in neither session can
follow the whole argument afterwards. Answer every ping — the turn is explicit, and a
discussion where both sides wait is indistinguishable from one that is finished.

A ruling only the author can make — for example whether a project skeleton counts as toil
(`tutorail-authoring#11`) — stays pending in writing until the author makes it. Do not
pre-empt it, and pass it to the session that owns the file it changes.

## A total is not a grade

A course's score is comparable **against its own lessons only**. The figure tracks how
finely a lesson's `## Suggested progression` enumerates clauses, so two bundles with
different house styles are not measured with the same ruler. Never rank the bundles by
total.

## Lesson numbers are ambiguous in `webgl-typescript-scene`

Its chapters 1 to 14 map to the files `00` to `13`, and its chapters 15 to 18 map to the
files `15` to `18`, because the old lesson 14 became the optional `minimal-gltf-loader`.
Name a lesson by its id, never by a bare number.
